            What is GitHub and how does it work?
            GitHub is the home for all developers—a platform where 
            you can share code, contribute to open source projects, 
            or even automate your workflow with tools like GitHub 
            Actions and Packages. If you’re just getting started 
            with GitHub, you may know us best as a place 
            for version control and collaboration.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">

        <div class="question">Is github safe?</div>
        <div class="answer">what's the difference? Simply put, 
            Git is a version control system that lets you manage 
            and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is 
            a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage 
            Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that 
            use Git, then GitHub is 
            designed to help you better manage them.

    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="question">Why should i use GitHub?</div>
        <div class="answer">GitHub isn’t just a place to share code. 
            It’s a chance to do something bigger. On GitHub, you can 
            shape the future of software, work with the best developers in the world, 
            and grow your skills and help others.</div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="question">Is GitHub worth it?</div>
        <div class="answer">Whether you are collaborating 
            or just using code on your own, getting on GitHub 
            is worth it: it gives you version control, 
            it helps others to see your code and learn 
            from it and it gives that 'open source feeling' 
            that everything is out in the open: 
            your data and data manipulations; everything is visible.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
